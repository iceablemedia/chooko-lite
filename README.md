## Description

Chooko Lite is a sweet, colorful and responsive theme for WordPress. Perfect for personal, fashion, beauty or cooking oriented blogs and creative websites.

It features two widgetizable areas in the sidebar and the optional footer, two custom menu locations in the navbar and footer, tagline display, custom logo and favicon, custom header image and custom background.

Chooko Lite is the lite version of [Chooko Pro](https://www.iceablethemes.com/shop/chooko-pro), which comes with many additional features and access to premium class pro support forum.

### Installation

#### From your WordPress dashboard

1. Visit "Appearance > Themes > Add New"
2. Search for "Chooko Lite"
3. Click "Install" and then "Activate".

#### From WordPress.org

1. Download [Chooko Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/chooko-lite/).
2. Upload the "chooko-lite" directory to your "/wp-content/themes/" directory, using your favorite method (ftp, FileManager, etc...)
3. Activate Chooko Lite from the Appearance > Themes page in wp-admin.

#### From GitHub

1. Clone or Download this repo.
2. Upload the "chooko-lite" directory to your "/wp-content/themes/" directory, using your favorite method (ftp, FileManager, etc...)
3. Activate Chooko Lite from the Appearance > Themes page in wp-admin.

### Getting started with Chooko Lite

* Once you activate the theme from your WordPress admin panel, you can visit the customizer (Appearance > Customize) to set your own logo, header image, background, menus etc.
* If you will be using a custom header image, you will find options to enable or disable it on your homepage, blog index pages, single post pages and individual pages.
* It is highly recommended to set a menu yourself, instead of relying on the default menu. Doing so will automatically activate the dropdown version of your menu in responsive mode.
* You can also set a custom menu at the bottom right of your site. Note this footer menu doesn't support sub-menus, only top-level menu items will be displayed.
* Footer widgets: The widgetizable footer is disabled by default. To activate it, simply go to Appearance > Widgets and drop some widgets in the "Footer" area, just like you would do for the sidebar. It is recommended to use 4 widgets in the footer, or no widgets at all to disable it.
* Additional documentation and free support forums can be found at https://www.iceablethemes.com under "support".
